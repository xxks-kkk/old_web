Welcome

Welcome to my page! I am a junior student majoring in `computer science`__,
`economics`__, and `mathematics`__ at `University of Wisconsin-Madison`__.

I am interested in Economics(i.e., econometrics, game theory), and programming(i.e, Python).
Particularly, I am interested in how to cooperate economics data analysis with the various tools incomputer science(i.e, linear programming, machine learning).

Currently, as an undegraduate student, I am working towards it by taking various courses in different fields that could fullfil my interest.
