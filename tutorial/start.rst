Introduction
============

Sphinx_ is a general-purpose documentation tool originally created for documenting Python projects.
Although it is the standard Python documentation tool, its capabilities extend far beyond simply compiling source code documentation.
Sphinx sports an impressive array of features, including

*   easy documentation markup with reStructuredText_
*   many output formats
*   `theme support`_ with several builtin themes
*   support for static files like images, CSS, and JavaScript
*   `customizable templates`_

In this tutorial, we'll see how to create multipage web sites quickly and easily using Sphinx.
Just as CSS helps to separate formatting information from the content of a site, Sphinx empowers the creation of consistent web sites by separating the content from the navigation and style components of the site.
With Sphinx, you can

*   create and edit content quickly and easily with reStructuredText
*   eliminate the repetitive and error-prone inclusion of navigation elements in every page
*   apply an existing theme to change the look and feel of your site
*   quickly build custom themes and styles to make your site unique
