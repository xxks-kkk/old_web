"If you would go up high, then use your own legs! Do not let yourselves carried
aloft; do not seat yourselves on other people's backs and heads."

**--Nietzsche**


"The Master in the art of living makes little distinction between his work 
and his play, his labor and his leisure, his mind and his body, his 
education and his recreation, his love and his religion. 
He hardly knows which is which. He simply pursues his vision of excellence
in whatever he does, leaving others to decide whether he is working or playing.
To him he is always doing both."

**--Zen Philosophy (found in Prof. Remzi's website)**
