====================
 PyMVPA - NiPy week
====================

The authors of the PyMVPA_ Multivariate Pattern Analysis toolkit will be
visiting the UC Berkeley Brain Imaging Center from April 14 until April 16
2009, to collaborate on the integration between PyMVPA and NiPy_.

As part of their visit, they will be presenting a two-part seminar on
multivariate pattern analysis. The first part is a general discussion on the
growing use of these techniques for data analysis in neuroscience, and the
second part is a more hands-on presentation of the pymvpa project.  We will
take a short break between the two parts (at 11am) so that you can attend only
one of them if you need.

See below for details on these presentations, and do not hesitate to contact
me if you'd like to schedule a technical discussion with Michael and Yarick
while they are visiting us.

Part 1: Reliable Decoding of Neural Data
========================================

* **When**: April 14 2009, 10 am
* **Where**: Tolman 5101

In the last five decades the number of techniques available for
non-invasive functional brain imaging has increased
dramatically. Researchers today can choose from a variety of neural
data modalities such as fMRI, EEG, MEG, etc.  The peculiarities of
each data acquisition modality and the lack of strong interaction
between the neuroscience communities employing them have produced
distinct analysis pipelines specialized for the conventional analyses
within a particular modality. Some analysis techniques have become,
due to normative concerns, de facto standards despite their
limitations and inappropriate assumptions for the given data type
(e.g. GLM in fMRI, ERP in EEG).

However, outside the neuroscience community, machine learning research
has spawned a set of analysis techniques that are typically generic,
flexible (e.g. classification, regression, clustering), powerful
(e.g. multivariate, linear and non-linear), and capable of efficient
use of both spatial and temporal evolutions of the signal.

Recently, neuroimaging researchers have begun to explore various
multivariate methods to address the shortcomings of the conventional
analysis approaches.  Drawing on the field of statistical learning
theory, new analysis techniques possess explanatory power that could
provide new insights into the functional properties of the brain.  By
constructing a decoder of neural data new analysis methods often
reverse the direction of the analysis and target the
description of the behavior or the environment in terms of the
registered neural activity.  Such reversed paradigm can account for
the covariance/causality structure within the data and often allows
for single-trial analysis of various neural data modalities by
decoding them into variables of interest.  Unbiased testing of the
decoder on new samples of the data provides an assessment of decoding
performance validity.  Furthermore, consecutive analysis of the
constructed decoder's sensitivity allows to identify neural signal
components relevant to the task of interest, hence providing desired
localization.  These features make decoding approach more powerful
than conventional hypothesis-testing univariate methods which
currently dominate the neuroscience field.

This part of the PyMVPA-series would urge the necessity in developing
decoding methods of neural data analysis and will present already
published approaches and results.



Part 2: PyMVPA: Fathom Brain Function with Multivariate Pattern Analysis
========================================================================

* **When**: April 14 2009, 11 am
* **Where**: Tolman 5101

Unlike the wealth of software packages for univariate analyses, there
are few packages that facilitate multivariate pattern classification
analyses of neural data.  We offer a complete analysis framework to
exploit techniques from statistical learning theory for the reliable
analysis of neural data.

Here we introduce a Python-based, cross-platform, and open-source
software toolbox, called PyMVPA, for the application of statistical
learning methods toward the analysis of various neural data
modalities.  PyMVPA makes use of Python's ability to access libraries
written in a large variety of programming languages and computing
environments to interface with the wealth of existing machine learning
packages.  In our strong belief it is important not to limit the
researcher in a single analysis paradigm as it is often done by
GUI-based toolkits formalizing a specific analysis approach.  Having
that in mind, PyMVPA can be viewed as a complete scripting environment
which is capable not only of replicating existing analysis methods,
but also versatile enough to implement a variety of custom analysis
paradigms based on statistical learning methods.

We will describe the PyMVPA framework: its building blocks and
convenience facilities. Furthermore we will provide illustrative
examples on its usage, features, and programmability.
