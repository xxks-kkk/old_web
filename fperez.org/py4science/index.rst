 Python for scientific computing
=================================

The Python language is an excellent tool for scientific computing and rapidly
growing in popularity.  This page gathers some information and resources on
this topic.

Resources
=========

`Py4Science meeting series at UC Berkeley <ucb/index.html>`_
  An open, informal series open to anyone interested in using, learning about
  or contributing to Python-based tools for scientific research.

`Code review meetings <code_reviews.html>`_
  A topic that bridges research and computing concerns.  The rationale and some
  guidelines on the why and how of having a discipline of group code reviews as
  part of our regular research workflow.
  
`Why Python? <why_python.html>`_
  A short page you may find useful if you are wondering why you should consider
  the Python language as a research tool [ This needs work at the moment...]
  
`A "Starter Kit" <starter_kit.html>`_
  If either I or someone else convinced you with a "why python?" discussion,
  and you are asking "OK, now what?", this may be useful.

`Warts <warts.html>`_
  No tool is perfect, this is the summary of my annoyances.
  
Blog_
  I (occasionally) post items related to this topic.

`Git resources <git.html>`_
  Not specific to Python, but rather a set of resources on how to use a good
  version control system as part of your daily workflow.

In reverse chronological order, links to meetings, discussions or other items
of interest on this topic.

November 2009, Guido van Rossum at our Py4Science seminar
  On November 4, we had a very interesting session with Guido van Rossum, the
  creator of the Python language.  See `this page <2009_guido_ucb/index.html>`_
  for details.

September 2009, PyDy
  At our meeting series, Luke Peterson from UC Davis gave a very interesting
  talk on PyDy_, a project under the SymPy_ umbrella to symbolically describe
  mechanical systems and derive their equations of motion.  Many thanks to Jeff
  Teeters for his continued work of `videotaping the lectures
  <http://www.archive.org/details/ucb_py4science_2009_09_30_Luke_Peterson>`_.

September 2009, decorators
  Some `notes about decorators for controlling execution <decorators.html>`_
  from a September 2009 talk at the Berkeley Py4Science group.

April 2009, PyMVPA
  We will be having a `PyMVPA/NiPy meeting <pymvpa_nipy_sprint_200904.html>`_,
  where we will work on integration issues as well as having two lectures by
  the PyMVPA team.

March 2009, *Expert Python Programming* book review
  I have recently received a copy of the book `Expert Python Programming
  <http://www.packtpub.com/expert-python-programming/book>`_ by Tarek Ziad√©,
  you can read my full `review here`_.

March 2009, SIAM CSE09
  I co-organized another Python mini-symposium at a SIAM meeting, this time the
  Computational Science and Engineering one.  I've `posted`_ a summary report
  on my blog, and `this page <2009_siam_cse>`_ has all the slides I have so
  far.

October 2008, 2-day hands-on workshop at UC Berkeley
  I'm holding a `2-day workshop <workshop_berkeley_2008.html>`_ introducing
  Python for scientists.  The workshop is now over, but most of the lectures
  were videotaped and can be found `here`__.

September 2008, PEP 225 for extended binary operators in Python
  Feedback `from the numpy community <numpy-pep225/README.html>`_ on Python's PEP
  225 regarding the implementation of new arithmetic operators.

June 2008, Python and Sage at the annual SIAM meeting
  I have posted `the slides I have <2008_siam>`_ from the Python/Sage
  minisymposium at the 2008 SIAM annual meeting.
