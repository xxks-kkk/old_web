 Version control with Git: resources
=====================================

If you are not using a version control system for all your software
development, paper writing, research code execution and tracking of the
generated results, you should.  There is simply no excuse today for not using
version control as a mechanism for tracking what you are doing with your source
materials and data (be they programming language files, LaTeX/LyX files, plain
text, even data results!).  Using version control frees you from the madness of
having directories with files named
``mypaper_version2_20100202_revisions_jim_v3_new_new2.tex``, for one thing.
It gives you a mechanism to synchronize your work with colleagues without
tracking who attached what version when, and a way to seamlessly replicate your
work, including its history, across computers.  Using a version control system
is much, much easier than you think, and today's best systems are powerful,
well documented and free.

This page isn't meant to be a tutorial, but rather a summary of useful
resources on using the Git_ software for version control.  Of the systems
available today (as of 2010) for version control, I only recommend people use
either git or mercurial; I've personally chosen git and find it to be an
extraordinary tool, though I have also used mercurial lightly and from what I
see regarding its development and uptake it is also a very good system.  Git
and mercurial are ultimately `quite similar in their architecture`_, and likely
to become even more alike in everyday use over time, as each team learns from
the other.

.. _quite similar in their architecture: http://mercurial.selenic.com/wiki/GitConcepts

I will not go here into historical details about other version control systems,
nor is this meant to encourage a comparison or discussion: I have extensive
experience with CVS, SVN and Bazaar, and only use those systems today *very*
reluctantly, when imposed by external constraints.  Git is simply that much
better for *my needs*.  Should you feel the urge to comment on this, please
send your message to one of the many online forums where debates on *this vs
that* are welcome, not to me.


Introductory materials
======================

There are lots of good tutorials and introductions for Git_, which you can
easily find yourself; this is just a short list of things I've found
useful.

For a beginner, I would recommend the following 'core' reading list, and below
I mention a few extra resources:

1. The concise GitRef_ reference: written by one of the authors of the
   excellent GitHub.com site, it's very compact but contains all the key ideas
   with the right approach.  If you only read one document, make it this one.

2. For a bit more detail, see the start of the excellent `Pro Git`_ online
   book, or similarly the early parts of the `Git community book`_.  Pro Git's
   chapters are very short and well illustrated; the community book tends to
   have more detail and has nice screencasts at the end of some sections.

3. For a different take, the `Git parable`_ is an easy read that walks you
   through how you would go about building a version control system with a
   little story.  By the end of this gentle document, you realize that Git's
   model is a very sound and clean one for the issues of source history
   control, management and collaboration.

If you are really impatient and just want a quick start, this `visual git
tutorial`_ may be sufficient.  It is nicely illustrated with diagrams that show
what happens on the filesystem.

.. _Visual git tutorial: http://www.ralfebert.de/blog/tools/visual_git_tutorial_1

`Understanding Git Conceptually`_ is an excellent document that I found
invaluable once I understood the basics.  Git has a reputation for being hard
to use, but I have found that with a clear view of what is actually a *very
simple* internal design, its behavior is remarkably consistent, simple and
comprehensible.  The user interface can be sometimes opaque (though it's
getting better), but I think the problems most people have arise from thinking
with a Subversion-type model and trying to simply find the corresponding
mimicking commands in git.  Since this often makes a mess, you will be far
better served by understanding a tiny bit of the underlying ideas: a little
time invested in this understanding will pay off in hassle-free work later.

.. _Understanding Git Conceptually: http://www.eecs.harvard.edu/~cduan/technical/git/

For windows users, `an Illustrated Guide to Git on Windows`_ is useful in that
it contains also some information about handling SSH (necessary to interface
with git hosted on remote servers when collaborating) as well as screenshots of
the Windows interface.

QGit_: an excellent Git GUI
  Git ships by default with gitk and git-gui, a pair of Tk graphical clients to
  browse a repo and to operate in it.  I personally have found qgit_ to be
  nicer and easier to use.  It is available on modern linux distros, and since
  it is based on Qt, it should run on OSX and Windows.

  Guides on a number of topics, some specific to github hosting but much of it
  of general value.

A port_ of the Hg book's beginning
  The `Mercurial book`_ has a reputation for clarity, so Carl Worth decided to
  port_ its introductory chapter to Git.  It's a nicely written intro, which is
  possible in good measure because of how similar the underlying models of Hg
  and Git ultimately are.

Collaboration: sharing repositories
===================================

While Git can be used strictly in 'private' mode, where you only keep
repositories in one computer, you will often want to share your work with
others.  The most natural way to do this is to have a repository located on a
system that is always online and to which both parties have access.  This
central location hosts a repository that can be read from and written to by
both, and acts as a synchronization point.

The resources above have sections explaining how to configure a server to
publish Git repositories, but for open source projects (or for private ones by
paying a fee), there are websites that provide this service with minimal
hassle.  I am most familiar with Github_, but Gitorious_ offers similar
services.

.. _Gitorious: http://gitorious.org

A noteworthy hosting service is Indefero_: while less well-known than Github
and Gitorious, its special feature is that the source code behind the website
is itself open source and it contains support for SVN, mercurial and git as
well as a wiki and a bug tracker.  This means that you can run Indefero on your
own server, with as many private repositories as you wish and the typical
amenities of a project (Gitorious is also open source, but has no bug tracker).
I use this for my own `private projects`_, and I have :doc:`some notes
</code/indefero_dreamhost>` that you may find useful on configuring Indefero on
your own server.

For SVN users
=============

If you want a bit more background on why the model of version control used by
Git and Mercurial (known as distributed version control) is such a good idea, I
encourage you to read this very well written post_ by Joel Spolsky on the
topic.  After that post, Joel created a very nice Mercurial tutorial, whose
`first page`_ applies equally well to git and is a very good 're-education' for
anyone coming from an SVN (or similar) background.

.. _post: http://www.joelonsoftware.com/items/2010/03/17.html
.. _first page: http://hginit.com/00.html

In practice, I think you are better off following Joel's advice and
understanding git on its own merits instead of trying to bang SVN concepts into
git shapes.  But for the occasional translation from SVN to Git of a specific
idiom, the `Git - SVN Crash Course <http://git-scm.org/course/svn.html>`_ can
be handy.

Tips
====

Better shell support
--------------------
(Sent by Nate Vack to the nipy mailing list)

Adding git branch info to your bash prompt and tab completion for git commands
and branches; they make git life really brilliant:

- http://github.com/slawcup/dotfiles/blob/master/.git-completion.bash

- http://railstips.org/blog/archives/2009/02/02/bedazzle-your-bash-prompt-with-git-info

Embedding Git information in LaTeX documents
--------------------------------------------

(Sent by `Yaroslav Halchenko <http://www.onerussian.com>`_)

I use a Make rule::

    # Helper if interested in providing proper version tag within the manuscript
    revision.tex: ../misc/revision.tex.in ../.git/index
	   GITID=$$(git log -1 | grep -e '^commit' -e '^Date:' | sed  -e 's/^[^ ]* *//g' | tr '\n' ' '); \
	   echo $$GITID; \
	   sed -e "s/GITID/$$GITID/g" $< >| $@

in the top level ``Makefile.common`` which is included in all subdirectories
which actually contain papers (hence all those ``../.git``).  The
``revision.tex.in`` file is simply::

    % Embed GIT ID revision and date
    \def\revision{GITID}

The corresponding ``paper.pdf`` depends on ``revision.tex`` and includes the
line ``\input{revision}`` to load up the actual revision mark.


Automatically make local branches track remotes
-----------------------------------------------

When checking out a remote branch with a local one, adding --track will ensure
that the new local branch is automatically a tracking branch.  But if you have
an existing local branch and you decide you want to push it remotely, you can
do it once by saying::

  git push <remote> <branchname>

or you can configure things (so the local branch becomes a tracking one with)::

  git config branch.<branchname>.remote <remote>
  git config branch.<branchname>.merge refs/heads/<branchname>

Note that as of git 1.7, this can be done with the simpler command::

  git branch --set-upstream <branchname> <remote>/<branchname>

and in all of these, it's possible to set the remote and local branch names to
be different, in case there's a conflict with your local name already existing
in the remote.

Using::

    git config branch.autosetupmerge true
    
Tells ``git-branch`` and ``git-checkout`` to setup new branches so that
``git-pull`` will appropriately merge from that remote
branch. Recommended. Without this, you will have to add ``--track`` to your
branch command or manually merge remote tracking branches with "fetch" and then
"merge".


git export
----------

Git doesn't have a native export command, but this works just fine::

  git archive --prefix=fperez.org/  master | gzip > ~/tmp/source.tgz

Setting default push/pull::

    (master)maqroll[0203_lecture2]> git push
    fatal: The current branch master is not tracking anything.

So do this::
    
    git config branch.master.merge refs/heads/master
    git config branch.master.remote origin

and now things work::

    (master)maqroll[0203_lecture2]> git push
    Counting objects: 8, done.
    Delta compression using up to 2 threads.
    Compressing objects: 100% (6/6), done.
    Writing objects: 100% (6/6), 84.82 KiB, done.
    Total 6 (delta 0), reused 0 (delta 0)
    To git@gfif.udea.edu.co:mscomp-2010.git
       807d520..0a8e2d2  master -> master


Interactive Rebase
------------------

One of the neat things about git is that you can modify your commits before you
push them up to a public, shared repository. Let's say you've made 10 commits
to your local git repository, but you want it to look like two when it gets
pushed up. All you need to do is type::

    git rebase -i HEAD~10

And git will launch your $EDITOR and allow you to perform what's referred to as
an "interactive rebase."
