 Python for scientific computing: a personal list of "warts"
=============================================================

While I don't hide the fact that I love Python for scientific computing work,
obviously no tool is perfect.  I happen to think that Python is, *today*, the
best *compromise* we have available that combines the following features:

- Open source, cross-platform and functional on a wide number of platforms,
  including supercomputers and other HPC environments.

- A high-level, very expressive language with readable syntax, a clean object
  model and useful built-in data types (strings, lists, dictionaries,
  sets, ...).

- A rich general-purpose library with support for common non-numerical tasks:
  networking, regular expressions and other text processing, database access,
  process management, operating system level tasks (file and directory
  manipulations), etc.

- A sophisticated array object for manipulating homogeneous collections of
  numerical data in a Fortran-like manner.

- A well-defined foreign function interface, and machinery to easily call
  existing codes in C, C++ and Fortran.

- A good body of bindings to common tools needed in scientific work: 2d and 3d
  plotting, numerical libraries, etc.

- Support for interactive work, including execution, visualization and
  debugging.

- Tools for documentation of code and automatic testing.

On any one of the above it's probably easy to find a better tool than Python,
but on the combination, I don't think that today we have any better option.
Perhaps in 10 years things will be different.

In the meantime, I'll focus on making Python as good of a tool as possible for
my own research, and one important aspect of working with a tool you've become
used to, is not forgetting about its problems and limitations.  We often get so
accustomed to the little (or big) problems in the tools we use that we simply
integrate workarounds into our mental workflows, and stop being critical.  This
is the start of the fossilization of a project, and I hope that doesn't happen
to us on the scientific python front.  So I'm trying to ask myself often about
what significant problems we still have in using Python efficiently every day
for scientific work, and occasionally third-parties also ask me this.

After a recent such discussion took place over email, I decided to make this
little page to track this question.  This is meant to serve both as a reminder
to myself of these problems, and hopefully also as a list of ideas for new
contributors to jump in and help in areas that genuinely require improvement.
Please `email me`_ with corrections, ideas for working on any of this, or your
own favorite problem.

Off the top of my head, here are a few of Python's "warts" for scientific work.
Some of these are fixable, others are hurdles that only impact the beginning
user who comes from Matlab or IDL.

I should add that almost all of these are points that I often mention as
*advantages* of Python (e.g. incremental optimization).  The solution to the
apparent contradiction is that I think we can still do much, much better, and
the fact that Python in some of these issues is better than everything else
that exists (not in all) should be no excuse to avoid improving things.

Linear algebra syntax
  For purely linear-algebra based problems, matlab's syntax can be cleaner than
  numpy's (multiplication, \ operator, array creation, etc).

Numpy ndarray is a complex object
  Numpy's core object is the n-dimensional array, which is far more powerful
  than matlab's arrays, but can be more complex to master.

More complex core types in the language
  Being a general language, it has multiple container types (sets, tuples,
  lists, n-dimensional arrays).  This flexibility can be daunting for the
  beginner and intermediate user who sometimes misuses them, though it is a
  huge benefit for more advanced algorithmic development.

Lack of native rationals
  I *really* wish Python had native rationals and that integer division
  produced rational results as needed.  Python's native numerical types are
  pretty good for a general purpose language, as it includes out of the box
  arbitrary-length integers, floats, complex numbers (over the 'field' of
  the floats) and even arbitrary-precision decimals_.  But the integers
  divide into the floats (they used to do integer truncating division, a la
  C).  Since this is part of the very core of the language, no amount of GMP
  wrappers will make it easier (this is why Sage_ has to preparse its input
  and convert input like ``1+2`` into ``Integer(1)+Integer(2)``, so that all
  integer operations are done in a proper manner without burdening the user
  with that syntax all the time).

Array multiplication operator
  I also wish that `PEP 225`_ or something like it were accepted, so that we
  could have at least a second multiplication operator to express constructs
  like matrix or vector products in addition to element-wise operations.  See
  :ref:`this page <pep-225-discussion>` for background on this matter.

Packaging and distribution is a mess
  The machinery for distributing python packages is brittle, buggy and
  generally a major pain to use and extend.  There is currently (summer 2009)
  active work to address this; the core ideas are listed in Python's `PEP 376`_
  and Tarek Ziadé (the person leading much of this effort) recently put up a
  `post on his blog`_ about it all.

Automatic testing
  The automated testing systems for python are currently a bit fragmented.
  Python ships with two (unittest_ and doctest_) but these lack critical
  functionality and ease of use, which has led to third-party systems like
  nose_, which isn't well integrated in the core.  It would be great to see a
  merge of the good ideas of nose into the core in a robust and stable way.
  *Note*: progress is being made on this front for Python 2.7/3.2.

Growing pains with Python 3
  The transition to Python 3 will cause some pain for a while, as the new
  version is not backwards compatible.

Integrated help and docs
  There is no single-point-of-entry set of tools with unified documentation and
  help system for Python.  The remarkable Sage_ project does offer something
  like this and is an extremely valuable piece of this puzzle (I use it
  myself). Sage is a viable solution to this problem, though it actually goes
  beyond the pure python language by extending its syntax and modifying
  Python's core numerical type hierarchy.  But in pure python, there is nothing
  that currently integrates execution, development, debugging and documentation
  with the polish of Mathematica or Matlab.

The infamous GIL
  The main python implementation in C has a global lock (the GIL, short for
  Global Interpreter Lock) that prevents multithreaded code from modifying
  python data structures.  So while python does support threads, they can only
  be used effectively for i/o bound tasks, not for cpu-bound ones.  Google's
  `Unladen Swallow`_ project aims to correct this, but we'll have to wait a few
  more months to see if it succeeds.  In the meantime, all parallel python code
  must use multiple processes, which can be a pain for certain valid use cases.

Very easy incremental optimization
  There is currently no seamless way to get fast execution for numerical code
  that manually loops over arrays and does indexing operations on individual
  elements.  In recent years, Matlab has developed JIT technology to support
  this, and currently no seamless equivalent exists for Python.  Cython helps
  quite a bit on this front, but it's not yet 100% integrated into the system
  machinery (though rapid progress is being made).

Better docstrings in the standard library
  For those of us who regularly work interactively, good docstrings make an
  enormous difference in the usability of a library.  It is thus unfortunate
  that the quality of the docstrings in Python's standard library is so
  inconsistent (from very good to non-existent).  Furthermore, I think we would
  all really benefit from having a standard for docstring formatting that
  included field descriptions for parametrs, return values, etc.  In that view,
  I think the `numpy docstring standard`_ is in fact a very good starting
  point, as it does a good job of balancing readability in plain-text
  (important if you read the docstrings in source form) and expressiveness for
  postprocessing into HTML or PDF via sphinx.
