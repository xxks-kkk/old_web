Some talks and presentations, in reverse chronological order:

`Python: a view from the floating-point side <1103_uwashington.pdf>`_
    March 2001, a talk presented at the `Sage Days 29`_ workshop, on the use of
    python for numerical work, with some historical personal background.

    William Stein recorded the talk and posted it online, as well as posting
    `some pictures from the last day`_ (for those who have asked, the anecdote
    about how I unplugged Colombia from the internet when I was a physics
    undergrad is from 0:11:20 to 0:14:12):

`Reproducible software vs. reproducible research <1102_aaas_reproducibility_fperez_slides.pdf>`_
    February 2011, a talk presented at the panel_ titled *The Digitization of
    Science: Reproducibility and Interdisciplinary Knowledge Transfer*, during
    the 2011 annual meeting of the AAAS.  An `extended abstract`_ is available
    that spells out some of the ideas I presented in the talk; I hope to
    complete this writeup into something a little more formal soon.
