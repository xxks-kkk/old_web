  I've finally gathered the `slides for our minisymposium on Python for
  Scientific computing <events/2011_siam_cse>`_ at the SIAM CSE 2011 conference
  (`blog post
  <http://blog.fperez.org/2011/04/python-goes-to-reno-siam-cse-2011.html>`_ and
  `pictures <https://picasaweb.google.com/fdo.perez/SIAMCSE2011InReno#>`_).

  The `Sage Days 29`_ workshop was a success on multiple fronts, and in
  particular for IPython we made a `ton of progress`_.

  During the I spoke during the `2011 AAAS annual meeting`_ at a symposium
  titled `The Digitization of Science: Reproducibility and Interdisciplinary
  Knowledge Transfer <http://www.stanford.edu/~vcs/AAAS2011/>`_ organized by
  Columbia's `Victoria Stodden`_.  I have put up a short `blog post`_ about the
  event as well as `my slides`_ and an `extended abstract`_.

  I'm thrilled to have been invited to present the keynote at this year's
  EuroScipy_ conference.  I haven't had a chance yet to attend the European
  version of the SciPy conferences, so I'm very much looking forward to it.

  My recent trip to `Scipy India 2010`_ was a very interesting experience; I'm
  really impressed by the Indian government's vision with their FOSSEE.in_
  project.  Here are the slides_ for my invited talk and some general
  pictures_, but I have yet to write a proper post summarizing things.  Stay
  tuned.

January 2010
  I'm very excited to visit Colombia for a month, to teach an intensive course
  on scientific computing using Python and a practical, modern and hopefully
  useful approach.  I've created a section on `Teaching <teaching>`_ with these
  materials, including a detailed page on the :ref:`planned course
  <scicomp_course>`.

December 2009
  :ref:`Some notes <indefero_dreamhost>` on how to configure InDefero_ on a
  shared hosting account to host your own Git repositories for private
  collaboration (e.g. co-authoring of grants and papers using Git, something
  you may not want to do on a public site).

November 2009, how this site is built
  I've added a :ref:`section <this_site>` with the tools used to build this
  site, which several people have inquired about.
  
November 2009, a discussion with Guido van Rossum
  At our informal Berkeley `Py4Science seminar`_, the November 4
  session was a very interesting discussion with Guido van Rossum, the creator
  of the Python language.  :ref:`Read more... <ucb_py4science_guido>`

September 2009, PyDy
  At our meeting series, Luke Peterson from UC Davis gave a very interesting
  talk on PyDy_, a project under the SymPy_ umbrella to symbolically describe
  mechanical systems and derive their equations of motion.  (`video link
  <http://www.archive.org/details/ucb_py4science_2009_09_30_Luke_Peterson>`_).

September 2009, decorators
