 Sharing Git repositories on Dreamhost with InDefero
=====================================================

This document explains how to install the InDefero_ project management system
on a shared host like Dreamhost. They should also be useful for any other
self-contained deployment with minor adjustments, as I've tried to explain in
detail a number of points that weren't too clear in the original documentation.
While these notes focus on Git, InDefero also supports Mercurial and SVN
backends; the installation part of this document may still be useful to you
even if you intend to use either of those backends.

I wanted to have a way of hosting my own Git repositories and projects for
collaboration with colleagues.  While I already use github_ for open source
projects, I wanted an easy solution for private collaboration.  For this type
of work I don't need all the bells and whistles of Github, my requirements are
pretty simple:

* Hosting multiple git repositories.
* Open source code I can run on my own server.
* The ability to add users and have different users on different projects,
  without needing to give each user a real shell account on the server.
* Basic code management features: source viewing, change log and commits.
* A few project documentation and ticket managemet features are welcome, but
  not a deal breaker.

I looked around quite a bit, and InDefero seemed to fit the bill best.  The
various \*Forge alternatives are enormous beasts, from what I found online
Trac's git support may still be a bit flaky (I found discouraging comments
about the plugin), Redmine looks neat but it requires a full Rails stack, which
I'm not really interested in getting into, and gitosis may be just a tad too
bare bones for what I wanted.  But InDefero kept appearing as a good balance of
the above, so I decided to give it a try.  I'd summarize it as a lightweight,
google-code-like project management system whose git backend design is inspired
by gitosis.  It also supports Hg and SVN backends, though I'm not interested in
those and won't discuss their configuration here (I turned them off).

So far I have been very satisfied in that I think it does precisely what I
need.  There are one or two minor things I'd like to have that I miss from
Trac, but in the end they are all sugar I can live without, since they involve
git history and log manipulations I can easily do with a local client.

The one thing that wasn't too easy was the installation: the documentation
isn't the best, the installation instructions are scattered across various
documents, and a number of key steps are not explained at all (not even
mentioned), so it took me a fair amount of time to get the whole thing working.
I am putting together these notes in the hope they save someone else time, and
the InDefero team is welcome to use any or all of this in their own documents.
I estimate that with a document like this one, you should be able to start from
scratch and configure an entire setup in 2-4 hours, assuming you are
comfortable working in a Linux command-line environment and are used to
building software from source.

Please let me know of any inaccuracies in this document so I can correct them
for the benefit of others.

Preliminaries
=============

The key sets of instructions that this document complements are:

* `InDefero general installation.`_
* Installation on `Dreamhost with Mercurial backend`_: this comes closest to
  our needs, but it's missing a few key pieces of information. Still, if
  something is missing in my notes, see this document.
* Configuring `the InDefero Git backend`_: another piece of the puzzle.
* The `Dreamhost notes on Git`_: they may be
  useful to you, though I think all of the pieces regarding git are contained
  here.

.. _indefero general installation.: idf_install_
.. _dreamhost with Mercurial backend: idf_dream_hg_
.. _the indefero git backend: idf_git_
.. _dreamhost notes on git: dream_git_

Hopefully if I missed something, the above should let you figure out the whole
thing.

For everything below, I have set the variable::

    PREFIX=$HOME/usr/local

and I have a set of bash utilities that configure my various ``*PATH``
variables so this is a valid installation prefix for me, so all installs will
be done using ``--prefix=$PREFIX``.  This means that the following path
variables are all properly configured::

    PATH: binary execution
    LD_LIBRARY_PATH: dynamic linker search path
    LIBRARY_PATH: static linking by gcc (like -L)
    CPATH: generic include path for gcc (like -I), used for all languages
    C_INCLUDE_PATH: C-specific include path, after CPATH
    CPLUS_INCLUDE_PATH: C++-specific include path, after CPATH
    PYTHONPATH: search path for python packages

I also use a little python script called unpack_ that knows how to unpack zip,
tar, gzip, bz2 and other formats with a single call, so I don't have to
constantly remember what to type.  If you don't use ``unpack``, simply
substitute the appropriate ``tar/unzip`` commands as needed.

.. _unpack: http://arctrix.com/nas/python/unpack


Dreamhost configuration
=======================

This section contains the various things you need to do on the Dreamhost
account, some of them via the control panel, some locally on the shell.
Basically, you will need:

* A custom domain for your InDefero install, along with a set of directories
  for it.
* A MySQL database.
* A new user whose purpose will be only to manage the Git repositories, and who
  will receive the SSH keys of your InDefero users.

We'll now see these in detail.

Domain configuration and file layout
------------------------------------
    
Since on a shared host I can't install in ``/home/www`` as the default
instructions suggest, I made a separate directory for the InDefero
installation, along with a sub-domain pointing to it.  In these instructions, I
will use ``example.com`` as the generic domain and ``site`` for the subdomain
hosting the InDefero site, substitute your values accordingly.

If the main site is called ``http://example.com``, then I created a subdomain
in the Dreamhost panel called ``http://site.example.com``, wich was pointed to
the directory ``$HOME/example.com/site/www`` as the serving directory.  The
extra ``www`` subdirectory is meant to host the actual public files (akin to
``/var/www`` in a non-shared host), while ``$HOME/example.com/site`` holds the
various files of the InDefero install, git repositories, etc.  Specifically, in
my case, the layout of ``$HOME/example.com/site`` is::

    drwxrwxr-x 3 2009-11-30 18:31 git_repos/
    drwxrwxr-x 2 2009-11-28 21:51 idf_upload/
    drwxrwxr-x 2 2009-11-28 21:51 idf_upload_attach/
    lrwxrwxrwx 1 2009-11-28 17:14 indefero -> indefero-0.8.8/
    drwxrwxr-x 8 2009-11-29 21:38 indefero-0.8.8/
    drwxrwxr-x 3 2009-12-01 03:41 mysql-dumps/
    lrwxrwxrwx 1 2009-11-28 23:50 pluf -> pluf-master-091126/
    drwxrwxr-x 7 2009-11-28 17:14 pluf-master-091126/
    drwxrwxr-x 2 2009-11-28 23:37 www/
    drwxrwxr-x 3 2009-11-30 18:00 tmp/

The ``www/`` directory where files actually get served from only contains::

    .htaccess -> ../indefero/www/.htaccess
    favicon.gif
    favicon.ico
    index.php -> ../indefero/www/index.php
    media -> ../indefero/www/media/

A local directory is needed for the actual git repositories.  The InDefero
suggested layout can't be used on a shared host, which is why there is a
``git_repos`` subdirectory shown above.  This will be put in the InDefero
config file later.

The ``mysql-dumps`` directory will be used to store backups of our database, as
explained below.

.. Note::

   I kept the main ``indefero`` and ``pluf`` directories as symlinks to the
   unpacked versions I downloaded, to make upgrades easier by repointing a
   symlink once things are tested to work (and to make backing off a problem a
   little easier).  I also created a git repo for each of indefero and pluf
   upon download, so that I can track my local changes as patches on git, which
   hopefully will make it easiet to upgrade by showing me precisely what I
   changed from the default install.


MySQL
-----

One thing the instructions didn't mention even in passing, is the separate
MySQL configuration steps required.  This may be common knowledge for someone
used to PHP, but it wasn't for me.  Using the Dreamhost panel, I made an SQL
database with::

    User: USER
    Host: mysql.site.example.com
    DB  : examplecom_site

For reference, the local login command is:

.. code-block:: bash

 mysql -u USER -p -h mysql.site.example.com examplecom_site


Local user for Git management
-----------------------------

We need a user to manage the git transactions.  All tutorials I've found
suggest the creation of a dedicated user called ``git``.  On dreamhost this
username is already taken, so I made another user (call it ``git2``), and also
created a custom group to which both ``git2`` and my normal user will belong.
As long as this information is given to the proper InDefero config variables,
the actual name of the user is irrelevant.

In the git user's home directory, don't forget to make the ``.ssh`` directory
with the proper permissions and make an empty ``authorized_keys`` file.  The
InDefero instructions for the SyncGit plugin explain this, but they assume you
have sudo access.  On a shared host this isn't the case, so you must do it
manually by logging in as the new user, and then running the rest of the
commands.  For reference (substitute ``git2`` with the name of your git user):

.. code-block:: bash

    su - git2  # become the new user manually
    cd
    mkdir .ssh
    touch .ssh/authorized_keys
    chmod 0700 .ssh
    chmod 0600 .ssh/authorized_keys
    exit

.. Note::

   On the Dreamhost panel, when creating the new user, do *not* select
   "enhanced security", because we need this new user to be able to share a
   group with the normal user, and if I understand correctly, "enhanced
   security" would lock down the new user too much.


Installing all the prerequisites
================================
   
OpenSSL and Curl (for Git)
--------------------------

As suggested by `this post`_, I built OpenSSL and Curl, as they provide some
extra functionality to the Git we'll build (the one on Dreamhost is very old).
In my case they may not have been 100% necessary, as right now I don't intend
to have my InDefero repositories pulling, but it's easy enough to do as part of
the whole build.  They are perfectly straightforward.  First, the latest
openssl:

.. code-block:: bash

    wget http://www.openssl.org/source/openssl-0.9.8l.tar.gz
    unpack openssl-0.9.8l.tar.gz
    cd openssl-0.9.8l
    ./config shared zlib --prefix=$PREFIX
    make
    make install

And similarly for Curl:

.. code-block:: bash

    wget http://curl.haxx.se/download/curl-7.19.7.tar.gz
    unpack curl-7.19.7.tar.gz 
    cd curl-7.19.7/
    ./configure --prefix=$PREFIX --with-ssl=$PREFIX
    make
    make install

.. _this post: http://www.ivankuznetsov.com/2009/07/setting-up-ruby-rails-git-and-redmine-on-dreamhost.html

If you have symbol version problems with OpenSSL, you may find the following
notes by `Jacobo de Vera`_ useful (thanks for the contribution!):

.. _Jacobo de Vera: Jacobo_
.. _Jacobo: http://blog.jacobodevera.com

The upstream version of OpenSSL does not include versioning symbols, since this
causes problems when more than one version of a library is present, the
versions of openSSL that are shipped with the main distros are patched to
include versioning symbols.  One of the symptoms of this is having those error
messages output whenever a tool that uses OpenSSL is executed::

    $ php
    php: /home/user/run/lib/libssl.so.0.9.8: no version information
    available (required by php)
    php: /home/user/run/lib/libcrypto.so.0.9.8: no version information
    available (required by php)
    php: /home/user/run/lib/libcrypto.so.0.9.8: no version information
    available (required by /usr/lib/libc-client.so.2002edebian)
    php: /home/user/run/lib/libssl.so.0.9.8: no version information
    available (required by /usr/lib/libc-client.so.2002edebian)
    php: /home/user/run/lib/libssl.so.0.9.8: no version information
    available (required by /usr/lib/libcurl.so.3)
    php: /home/user/run/lib/libcrypto.so.0.9.8: no version information
    available (required by /usr/lib/libcurl.so.3)

What I have done to avoid this, since I compiled my own OpenSSL in
order to build a newer version of GIT (to replace the default one
provided by Dreamhost), is to follow the steps that distros do,
described in a comment here::

    > http://rt.openssl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=1222&user=guest&pass=guest
    > For that to happen I introduced a version script openssl.ld with the
    > following contents:
    >
    > OPENSSL_0.9.8 {
    > global:
    > *;
    > };
    >
    > It has to be in the toplevel directory and in the engines directory.
    >
    > The SHARED_LDFLAGS get the additional options
    > -Wl,--version-script=openssl.ld

SHARED_FLAGS is a variable in the Makefile that is generated by config.  After
installing this version, the errors disappear.

Git
---

The `dreamhost wiki page on git`_ has more details, including the NO_MMAP
suggestion to prevent dreamhost from killing git processes that access large
files via mmap (this triggers a false positive on their automatic memory
police).  In my case, I built v1.6.5.3.  After unpacking the sources, I used:

.. code-block:: bash

  ./configure --prefix=$PREFIX --with-openssl=$PREFIX --with-curl=$PREFIX
  make NO_MMAP=1 install

Note that you *must* give the NO_MMAP flag in the install step, else git will
get rebuilt if you only give it in the make step and then try to run a simple
``make install``.

PEAR and PHP tools
------------------

The indefero docs put this later, but to be 100% sure that all subsequent
pear/php commands run using the proper versions, I think it's safest to first
set up the environment by putting this into the bashrc file and reloading:

.. code-block:: bash

    # PEAR/PHP install at dreamhost
    export PHP_PEAR_PHP_BIN=/usr/local/php5/bin/php
    export PATH=$HOME/usr/pear:/usr/local/php5/bin:$PATH

Now, we can do a local pear install.  It seems pear also needs some caching
directories, and I don't know enough about it to be sure it's safe to have the
caching directories below the root pear path, so I'm keeping them separate.  I
made the following directories:

.. code-block:: bash

    mkdir -p ~/usr/var/pear/cache
    mkdir -p ~/usr/var/pear/temp

``~/usr/pear`` will be the root pear tree, and ``~/usr/var`` will hold
server-style data in a single location, and will use that for the PEAR
temporary directories.  The indefero installation instructions suggest using
``~/tmp/pear``, but I don't like keeping anything that I can't simply destroy
on ``~/tmp``, so I used this layout instead.

Now I can create the pear config:

.. code-block:: bash

    pear config-create ~/usr/ ~/.pearrc
    pear config-set download_dir ~/usr/var/pear/cache/
    pear config-set cache_dir ~/usr/var/pear/cache/
    pear config-set temp_dir ~/usr/var/pear/temp/

With this configured, I can now run the install and it all worked fine:

.. code-block:: bash

    pear install -o PEAR
    pear install --alldeps Mail
    pear install --alldeps Mail_mime

A quick check gives me::

    [usr]> pear list
    INSTALLED PACKAGES, CHANNEL PEAR.PHP.NET:
    =========================================
    PACKAGE          VERSION STATE
    Archive_Tar      1.3.3   stable
    Auth_SASL        1.0.3   stable
    Console_Getopt   1.2.3   stable
    Mail             1.1.14  stable
    Mail_Mime        1.5.2   stable
    Mail_mimeDecode  1.5.0   stable
    Net_SMTP         1.3.4   stable
    Net_Socket       1.0.9   stable
    PEAR             1.9.0   stable
    Structures_Graph 1.0.3   stable
    XML_Util         1.2.1   stable

The above worked for me, but Jacobo_ notes that he actually needed to do a full
PEAR install, his notes are below in case you also need a from-scratch PEAR
build (still assuming the PATH configuration listed above):

The version of PEAR that is currently available in DreamHost is so old that
``Archive_Tar``, which is a dependency of the newer PEAR, will not accept to be
installed.

I wanted a clean PEAR installation, like the ones resulting from running ``pear
install -o PEAR``, but, ironically, first I needed a newer PEAR :)

I created a temp directory ``~/tmpear`` and then ran this:

.. code-block:: bash

    cd ~/tmpear
    curl http://pear.php.net/go-pear | php

Said yes to everything but changed the installation prefix to be
``$HOME/tmpear``.  Once that was finished, ran this:

.. code-block:: bash

    $HOME/tmpear/bin/pear config-create $HOME/usr .pearrc
    $HOME/tmpear/bin/pear install -of PEAR

Notice the -f flag, otherwise it won't reinstall it:

.. code-block:: bash

    rm -rf $HOME/tmpear


I then installed the rest of the needed packages:

.. code-block:: bash

    pear install -a Mail
    pear install -a Mail_Mime
   
Install and configure Pluf/InDefero
===================================

Once I had the file layout ready, for the actual installation of Pluf and
Indefero, I followed the instructions as listed in part 3 of the InDefero
`Dreamhost/Mercurial`_ instructions pretty much to the letter.  That section
describes fairly well the changes needed to the generic InDefero install
(explained here_).

.. _Dreamhost/Mercurial: http://projects.ceondo.com/p/indefero/page/Installation-Dreamhost-Mercurial/

.. _here: http://projects.ceondo.com/p/indefero/page/Installation

This is the part where most of the work goes, in editing the configuration of
the ``conf/idf.php`` file (along with a few changes to ``path.php``)

In the ``conf/idf.php`` file, I created this block of variables that summarizes
most of my configuration:

.. code-block:: php

    # fperez - variables
    $fp = 'example.com';
    $fp_home = '$HOME';
    $fp_site = '$HOME/example.com/site';
    $fp_git_user_home = '/home/git2';
    $fp_git_repos = "$fp_site/git_repos";
    $fp_site_url = 'site.example.com';
    $fp_mail_user = 'nobody@nowhere';
    $fp_db_login = 'USER';
    $fp_db_password = '???';
    $fp_db_server = "mysql.$fp_site_url";
    $fp_database = 'examplecom_site';

Then, with those variables I constructed the values for everything below in the
actual file, minimizing repetition of paths and making the whole thing a bit
easier to understand (for me).

In particular, don't forget that the MySQL information must then be properly
put into the php configuration file also:

.. code-block:: php

    # Database configuration
    $cfg['db_login'] = $fp_db_login;
    $cfg['db_password'] = $fp_db_password;
    $cfg['db_server'] = $fp_db_server;
    $cfg['db_version'] = '5.0'; # Only needed for MySQL
    $cfg['db_table_prefix'] = 'indefero_';
    $cfg['db_engine'] = 'MySQL';
    $cfg['db_database'] = $fp_database;

A few other configuration variables that rely on the ones above, and on the
directory layout previously explained for our site:

.. code-block:: php

    $cfg['url_upload'] = "http://$fp_proj_url/media/upload";
    $cfg['upload_path'] = "$fp_proj/idf_upload";
    $cfg['upload_issue_path'] = "$fp_proj/idf_upload_attach";
    $cfg['tmp_folder'] = "$fp_proj/tmp";
    $cfg['pear_path'] = "$fp_home/usr/pear/php";
    $cfg['git_path'] = "$fp_home/usr/local/bin/git";


Initialize Pluf and InDefero
============================

Once the db information above is correctly entered into the php config, the
following should work, executed in the ``indefero/src`` directory::

    $ php ../../pluf/src/migrate.php --conf=IDF/conf/idf.php -a -i -d
    PHP include path: $HOME/usr/pear/php:.:/usr/local/php5/lib/php:/usr/local/lib/php:$HOME/example.com/site/pluf-master/src
    Install all the apps
    Pluf_Migrations_Install_setup
    IDF_Migrations_Install_setup


Next, run the boostrap script to create the first user.  Once that's working,
use this .htaccess file::

    Options +FollowSymLinks
    RewriteEngine On
    RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
    RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d
    RewriteRule ^(.*) /index.php?_pluf_action=$1

to get shorter urls for projects. Note: the last line is different from that on
the website, and this is the correct one (from a message on the mailing list by
the author).

You should now have a running installation, try it out by creating a new
project.  Enjoy!

.. Note::

   By default, InDefero does *not* create empty repositories on the server, nor
   is there an option to do so.  The recommended workflow is simply to create
   the project on the server, then make a local repository and push to the
   InDefero host (the 'Source' tab for each project has nice copy/paste
   instructions for this).

New users
=========

InDefero is meant as a public forge, but in my case I don't actually need
outsiders to create new accounts, and in fact I don't want the functionality.
I will create new accounts manually only for collaborators I am going to work
with, and this is easily done by running again the bootstrap script with
different user information.  These users can then change their password via the
web interface to whatever they want.

I actually disabled new account creation by simply commenting out from
``src/IDF/templates/idf/login_form.html`` the "I am new here" entry that
normally leads to the new account page.  Just surround the relevant line with
``{*`` and ``*}`` comment markers::

    > git diff HEAD~2 login_form.html
    diff --git a/src/IDF/templates/idf/login_form.html b/src/IDF/templates/idf/login
    _form.html
    index 624d613..93d5566 100644
    --- a/src/IDF/templates/idf/login_form.html
    +++ b/src/IDF/templates/idf/login_form.html
    @@ -10,8 +10,9 @@
     <p><label for="id_login">{trans 'My login is'}</label> <input type="text" name=
    "login" id="id_login" value="{$login}" /></p>

     <h3>{trans 'Do you have a password?'}</h3>
    -<p><input name="action" id="action-new-user" value="new-user" type="radio" /> <
    label for="action-new-user">{trans 'No, I am a new here.'}</label></p>
    -
    +{*
    +<p><input name="action" id="action-new-user" value="new-user" type="radio" /> <

    ord">{trans 'my password is'}</label> <input type="password" name="password" id=
    "id_password" /></p>

     <p><input type="submit" value="{trans 'Sign in'}" />

If you want to *really* disable creation in full, you should also replace the
``indefero/src/IDF/templates/idf/register/index.html`` template with a mostly
empty page, since otherwise people can still just navigate to the
``site.example.com/register`` url and will get the registration page.  This is
what I did for my actual site.

If you make changes to the html templates, remember to flush the temporary and
cache directories to force a refresh of the public pages.     


SSH key synchronization and security
------------------------------------

One small nugget that is stated in the `InDefero Git docs`_ but is not very
clearly explained is how new users are given permissions to the repositories.
This requires two things: a little cron job run *by the special git user* and
understanding how the keys are managed.

.. _indefero git docs: idf_git_

Your InDefero users do not have shell access to your server; in order to use
the repositories they must upload their SSH public key through the web
interface.  Every time a user's SSH key is uploaded, InDefero leaves a little
temporary file (its name is stored as ``$cfg['idf_plugin_syncgit_sync_file']``)
and InDefero ships with a php script that detects this file and syncs the SSH
key from the database over to the ``~/.ssh/authorized_keys`` file of the
special git user.  You can run this script manually to sync users, and it's a
good idea to leave it as a cron job in case users update their SSH keys later;
the script is ``indefero/scripts/gitcron.php``.

An important point is that when these keys are uploaded, they do *not* give
your InDefero users unrestricted login access, as this would defeat the
isolation between projects that InDefero offers.  Their SSH keys are saved as
authorized, but *only* to run a single command, a little python script called
``indefero/scripts/gitserve.py`` that checks that user's permissions in the
database, and only gives them access to the repositories consistent with those
permissions.  This ensures that the special git user is not a security hole
that would allow one user who knew the path to another repository he's normally
not allowed access, to read it bypassing the web interface.  Many thanks to
Loic D'Anterroches, the InDefero project lead, for clarifying this point.


Backing things up
=================

OK, you now have a system up and running.  How do you back it up?  Most of the
state of the project lives on the file system (and can thus be backed up with a
simple ``rsync`` call), except for the SQL database.  A simple way to handle
this is to back it up manually once, and then to store this backup into a git
repository.  We can then run a cron job on the server that periodically runs a
backup again, and then commits the changes to the repo.  By storing an
uncompressed dump of the backup, we make it easy for git to compute diffs and
to later compress the entire repository efficiently.

We start by running a manual backup once:

.. code-block:: bash

    cd mysql-dumps
    mysqldump --opt -uUSER -pPASSWD -h HOSTNAME DBNAME > DUMPFILE

with this in place, we can now initialize the git repo:

.. code-block:: bash

    git init
    git add DUMPFILE
    git ci -m"Initializing: repo to hold backups of SQL database for InDefero site."

And now, we can add a cron job that runs every night a script like:

.. code-block:: bash

    #!/bin/bash
    # Dump a backup of mysql database and store it in git repo.

    #######################################################
    # Configure here with your information
    user=YOUR_SQL_USERNAME
    hostname=YOUR_SQL_HOSTNAME
    passwd="????"
    dbname=YOUR_DATABASE_NAME
    outdir=$HOME/example.com/site/mysql-dumps

    # Make sure we use our own git
    git=$HOME/usr/local/bin/git
    
    #######################################################
    # Code below
    dumpfile=$dbname.sql

    cd $outdir
    mysqldump --opt -u$user -p$passwd -h $hostname $dbname > $dumpfile
    # Store the history in git itself.
    $git commit -a -m"Automated backup"
    # Run gc every time to compact repo and save space
    echo "Optimizing repository"
    $git gc

Since this script has to hold your SQL password in plain text, make it
read-execute only for your user, and don't use an important password there.
Alternatively, if you want to play it safer, you can take the password as an
argument and initiate the backup process remotely over SSH, from a trusted
host.  For my purposes this is sufficient.

Once the SQL database is nicely backed up in our site directory, the entire
project state consists of plain files, and we can simply rsync it nightly to a
remote host for off-site backup.
    
That's it.  Every night the SQL database is backed up, and git gives us a
revision history that is also very space efficient, as the gc step ensures that
days with no real changes don't take any extra space on disk (I tested this).
A regular rsync off-site ensures that I have the entire site state and history
safely stored, should anything happen at Dreamhost.


Final comments
==============

So far I think InDefero does what I need it to.  I hope to clarify a few small
questions I have on the list (the author has been very responsive to my queries
so far), but I think I'll stick with it.

A few final points that I did not cover in these notes but that you may need
in your own setup:

Email

    I did not configure email delivery, as I only expect to make a few new
    users and I will do it by hand.  Jacobo_ notes that if you eliminate from
    the IDF config file all email-related options, then the PEAR Mail module's
    defaults should work; I haven't tested this myself.

Git-daemon

    This is mentioned in the last step of the official instructions, but the
    basic Dreamhost plan does not allow me to run daemons.  However, git-daemon
    is only needed if you want to provide anonymous access to your
    repositories.  This is not my case (I use github.com for all my public
    code), so I didn't look further into this topic.
