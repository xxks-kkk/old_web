 Software Tools
================

This page contains a collection of miscellaneous little software tools that
don't fit into any larger project but could be useful for someone.  Unless
otherwise specified, they are all released under the terms of the BSD license.

These days, I keep most new public projects available at my `github
repository`__, which makes for a convenient download system and lets you send
me back all the great improvements you'll undoubtedly make.

InDefero on Dreamhost
=====================

If you are interested in hosting your own projects privately using Git, but
with some facilities for project management (web interface to git, source
listings, issue tracking, etc), you may find `these notes
<indefero_dreamhost.html>`_ on configuring the InDefero system on a shared host
useful.

How this site is built
======================

A number of people have asked me for the tools used to build this site, so here
is a brief description.  The entire site is built using the wonderful Sphinx_
toolset, with the addition of a few custom scripts.  For the impatient, you can
download `here <fperez.org.tgz>`_ an archived export of most of the sources to
this site.  After unpacking this, you can type::

  make

and you should be left with a semi-functional copy of my site in the
``_build/html`` directory which you can see with a browser (note that some
links will be dead, since I removed most of the content to keep the download
small).

Then, edit the ``conf.py`` file and the ``Makefile`` to suit your needs.

Below are slightly more detailed instructions on what to do if this was too
terse for your taste.

.. note::

   If you use this material, please change the color schemes and other details
   in the ``themes/fperez`` directory as well as the main images.  I've left
   them in place so things build out of the box, but I'd much prefer it if your
   site did *not* have all the colors, layout and pictures identical to mine.

   
Tools needed
------------

Before getting started, make sure you have the following on your computer, else
nothing will really work:

* Make: standard on Linux, you may need to install XCode on OSX.
* Python_: Required for Sphinx and for my scripts to run.
* Sphinx_: The main documentation building tool.
* ImageMagick_: you only need this if you want to use my little thumbnail
  script (see below).
* Rsync: Standard on Linux and OSX, used to upload the site contents to a
  public location.
* Firebug_: pretty much needed to do *any* kind of debugging of web material.

Workflow
--------

These tools work with a very simple approach: the ``conf.py`` file configures
things for Sphinx, the ``themes/fperez`` directory contains the layout and CSS
necessary to render the site (this is configured in ``conf.py``), and the main
Makefile has targets to build the files, update the css for testing cosmetic
changes, and to upload the final content to a public site.  The initial steps
to get the system ready are:

#. Edit ``conf.py`` to suit your taste.

#. Please change the theme name and contents as requested above to your own.

#. Edit the ``Makefile`` to indicate where you will upload the final site (the
   ``WWW`` variable).  To make your life easier on uploads, I suggest you
   configure things for passwordless SSH key-based access, but that's up to
   you.

With these things ready, the normal workflow is:

1. Edit files for content.

2. To build the site, type:

::

   make

3. View the resulting site at ``_build/html/index.html`` in your browser.

4. If you need to make changes to the CSS files only, type:

::

  make css

for a quick update without needing a full rebuild.

5. Occasionally if things don't look right, do a full cleanup/rebuild via:

::

  make clean
  make

6. Once you are happy with the results locally, push to your public site with:

::

  make upload

  
Additional details and Background reading
-----------------------------------------
  
If you are interested in building a site with the same workflow, I recommend
that you first:

* Have a quick read of the official Sphinx_ documentation to get an idea of how
  things work.  Don't go into too much detail, but knowing where the main ideas
  are described in the docs will save you time later.

* Do pay attention to the reST notes, because that's the syntax you'll be using
  to actually write.  Note that on this site, I've left always visible the
  "Show Source" links on the right-hand navigation bar, which can be a useful
  way to learn how things are done.  If you see anything in a page you are
  curious about, just click that link.

* Run through the very nice Sampledoc_ mini-tutorial written by John Hunter
  (matplotlib_'s lead developer).  That tutorial will get you 90% of the way
  there, and in fact you may find it sufficient for your purposes.

I personally needed a little bit on top of sampledoc; in particular I wanted
finer control over the layout of the site and decided to build a full Sphinx
theme (albeit a minimally modified one), and I also wanted some tools to
statically upload files like PDFs, zip archives or any other content I might
have in subdirectories into the public site.  By default sphinx does not upload
non-reST files in any other directory than its ``_static`` one, and I wanted to
be able to populate arbitrarily nested subdirectories with material like
papers, talks or software packages, and have those files uploaded *in the same
location* to the public site.

To achieve that, there's a simple script called `copy_trees
<../copy_trees.py>`_ that copies my input trees to the Sphinx output build
directory prior to synchronization to the public site.

I also have written a tiny thumbnailer script, `mkthumb <../mkthumb>`_ that you
may find useful to quickly create smaller images for inline display.  Note that
this needs the ``convert`` utility from the ImageMagick_ suite.

Python tools for Mathematica and Fortran
========================================

With Sage_ and Sympy_, I have much less of a need for Mathematica, but I've
previously needed to easily transfer quantities between Mathematica and Python.
If you have similar needs, you may find these tools useful (please drop me a
line if you do).

* A Mathematica notebook, `math2python.nb`_, defining functions to produce a
  Python module (meaning, valid, importable Python syntax) that contains
  variables from Mathematica.  It will export all numbers as floats and (even
  nested) lists as numpy arrays.

* A Python module, `py2mathematica.py`_ that does the opposite: it saves a list
  of Python variables to a valid Mathematica ``.m`` file, which can be loaded
  in Mathematica with the ``<<fname`` syntax.  This module is fairly well
  documented.

I also have on occasion needed to produce static Fortran tables of quantities
computed elsewhere.  Not so much from Python, but from Mathematica, and it
turned out to be much easier to use the above tools to do the Mathematica ->
Python conversion, and then generate valid Fortran from Python, than to
convince Mathematica to do the job (its string manipulation API, at least back
in version 5.0, was hideous beyond redemption).  If you ever need to generate
Fortran (77) from data you have in Python, then `py2fortran.py`_ may come in
handy.

X11 keyboard control
====================

I recently modified and extended this `great little script`_ to control a
keyboard under X11.  My use for it is to take advantage of the special keys in
my Microsoft Wireless keyboards under Linux, so I can control XMMS, call up
Mozilla, Konqueror, gthumb, etc.

It's a simple module which you can `find here`_, and I call it via this_ little
script which you can modify for your particular usage case. It should be very
easy to customize it for any keyboard and any behavior you want.

Note that you'll need the `Xlib python`_ module.

The attic: lyxport
==================

Today, LyX has very robust PDF export (and probably also HTML).  But that
wasn't the case in 2001, so I wrote this little tool in Perl called lyxport_
which managed to reliably produce valid PDF and HTML out of lyx or tex sources
better than LyX itself.

Today this code is probably of no interest, this is kept here mainly as a
curiosity and for archival purporses.  But it was my first open source tool
that saw some widespread use, and I learned a lot writing it even if the code
looks awful today, even for the dubious standards of Perl code.
