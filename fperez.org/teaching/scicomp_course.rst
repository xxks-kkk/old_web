 Modern Scientific Computing
=============================

An intensive course on the modern practice of scientific computing aimed at the
late-undergraduate or graduate level in the physical sciences, mathematics and
engineering.


Introduction
============

Scientific computing, broadly understood as the use of computational resources
to solve research-specific problems, has in the last decade grown immensely in
its reach across disciplines as well as changing in nature.  The vast majority
of computational effort in science during the XXth century was devoted to the
solution of numerical problems (first exclusively with Fortran and then
including other languages).  But in the past two decades, higher-level
environments that allow for more rapid and flexible development and incorporate
extensive libraries, data analysis and interactive exploration have become
extremely popular.  This was pioneered by the creation of Matlab and IDL,
followed by systems with symbolic capabilities like Mathematica and Maple, all
of them commercial products.

Simultaneously, we reached the point where today, scientists from virtually
every discipline need to perform extensive computational work.  This is partly
thanks to the existence of such systems that enable someone who is not an
expert at low-level programming to perform sophisticated computational tasks,
but also fueled by the explosion of data that is flooding many fields in a way
that inescapably mandates a change towards semi-automated, large-scale
computational analysis and modeling (for a particularly interesting example of
this, see `Josh Bloom's`_ current work on `automatic real-time astronomical
data acquisition and analysis`__)

In the last decade, open source alternatives to the above commercial systems
have emerged, and the most successful ones are all based on the Python_
programming language, supported by a vast array of additional tools and
libraries to do everything from basic array manipluation to sophisticated
modeling and visualization.

This course will present a practical perspective on these tools, targeted at
the level of graduate students in the physical sciences, mathematics and
engineering.  By practical we mean that we will not spend much time proving
theorems regarding the convergence rate of a particular algorithm, for example.
We *will* spend time discussing issues that sit at the intersection of
scientific computing and software engineering, such as: documentation, testing
and validation of codes, as well as version control and the participation of
scientists as developers of their own research tools in open-source
collaborations.  This is important, because I have found through painful
experience that often, scientific research projects have difficulties not
because we aren't smart enough (we never are) or we don't work hard enough (we
actually do put in a lot of time).  The problems arise because of a nasty
interlocking mess of poor *practices* regarding tool development, data
management and accrual of verifyable results that leads to highly sub-optimal
outcomes.  This course will then try to at least touch on these topics as a
natural part of the workflow.  Rather than repeating here what others have said
better I'd encourage you to look at Greg Wilson's excellent `Software
Carpentry`_ materials, as well as a related `post by Joel Spolsky`_ which,
despite being made in the context of a commercial software house, in my opinion
applies 100% to our problem of interest.

Format
======

The course is organized around 24 hands-on 2-hour sessions, where we will mix
short presentations with work on actual problems to illustrate and explore.
The class will take place in a computer lab where systems that have all the
prerequisites pre-installed are available, but you are also welcome to bring
your own laptop if you so desire.  I will present short problems during class
which you will be given some time to try and solve, and whose solution we will
then discuss immediately; longer problems will be given as homework.

At the end of the course, a final project will be required of each student,
which can take one of two forms:

- A draft implementation of something of interest for one of your courses or
  research projects.  I will be happy to discuss your problem and make
  suggestions on tools you can use as a starting point.  You should plan on
  having something that does *run and produce some result* by the end of the
  course, even if it is preliminary in nature.

- A *working* improvement to any of the open-source tools we will be discussing
  and using in the course (ipython, numpy, scipy, matplotlib, mayavi, sympy,
  cython, sage, etc).  You can fix an existing bug report, improve the
  documentation or implement a new feature.  The choice of open-source project
  and specific task is yours, but I will expected you to actually produce the
  solution in the format expected by the project.  This typically means joining
  its development mailing list, learning how to file the appropriate
  information in its bug tracking system and how to prepare your work for
  submission.
  

Tools required
==============

If you wish to install the tools in your own system, you can find the necessary
information in my `"Starter Kit" <../py4science/starter_kit.html>`_ page.  It
is important that you actually *run* the `checklist script`_, which for example
on my Ubuntu 9.10 system produces::

    > python workshop_checklist.py 
    Running tests:
    __main__.test_imports('setuptools',) ... MOD: setuptools, version: 0.6c9
    ok
    __main__.test_imports('IPython',) ... MOD: IPython, version: 0.11.bzr.r1346
    ok
    __main__.test_imports('numpy',) ... MOD: numpy, version: 1.3.0
    ok
    __main__.test_imports('scipy',) ... MOD: scipy, version: 0.7.0
    ok

    [ lots of intermediate output removed ]

    Simple plot generation. ... ok
    Plots with math ... ok

    Ran 21 tests in 37.571s

    OK

    If the printout above did not finish in 'OK' but instead says 'FAILED', copy
    and send the *entire* output (all info above and summary below) to the
    instructor for help.

Prerequisites
=============

This course assumes the level of a graduate student in the physical sciences,
math or engineering, with a grasp of calculus, linear algebra, ordinary
differential equations, basic statistics and elmentary numerical methods.

In addition, we will assume a *reasonable familiarity with programming*.  If
you have never programmed in your life, I am afraid this is not the course for
you: I will not be teaching basic programming concepts from scratch.  Python is
an extremely readable language, and its syntax is regular and easy to remember,
but this doesn't change the fact that some ideas in programming require a
certain amount of practice to understand.

You must also *work through* (not just read, but actually type in and execute)
the basic `Python tutorial <http://docs.python.org/tutorial>`_, as well as the
`introductory NumPy tutorial <http://mentat.za.net/numpy/intro/intro.html>`_.
I will explain Python syntax and language details as we go, but I will do so
quickly; it is therefore *really* important you have some practice with the
basics of the language and of Numpy arrays first.

Specifically, I assume you have read and understood these topics (you don't
have to be an expert, I will cover all of these, but they should be reasonably
familiar to you in general, and specifically in how Python implements them):

* Basic types of the language (numbers, strings, lists, dictionaries)
* Function definition syntax
* Control flow primitives (if/else, for, while, break, continue)
* What an exception is, how to raise one and how to catch one
* How to define and instantiate a class
* How to open a text file on disk and read its contents
* How to write numbers to a text file on disk
* What a numpy array is and how it differs from a python list
* What basic operations a numpy array supports
* How to create a numpy array of uniform random numbers in a given interval

(hint: all of these are covered in the basic tutorials linked above).

Please see the `"Starter Kit" <../py4science/starter_kit.html>`_ page for
detailed links to multiple references available online.
