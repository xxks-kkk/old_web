I sometimes teach both short workshops and longer courses on scientific
computing built around Python-based tools.  This page is a central resource for
teaching materials, though obviously the :ref:`Py4Science` pages are also
relevant for this topic.

Course: Modern Scientific Computing
  An month-long, intensive (6 hours a week) course on the modern practice of
  scientific computing, using mostly Python-based tools and aimed at the
  late-undergraduate or graduate level in the physical sciences, mathematics
  and engineering. :ref:`More... <scicomp_course>`

February 2010: Universidad de Antioquia, Medellín, Colombia
  For the whole month, I'll be teaching the course linked above at the Physics
  department (where I did my undergraduate studies).  :ref:`Specifics with
  local logistics (in Spanish)... <udea_2010>`

February 2010: Universidad de los Andes, Bogotá, Colombia
  I will present a general lecture on scientific computing and will teach a
  one-day workshop at Uniandes, in Bogotá. :ref:`More... <uniandes_2010>`
