March 2011, SIAM CSE11
  Yet another successful Python mini-symposium at a SIAM CSE meeting organized
  with Randy LeVeque and Hans-Petter Langtangen. `This page <2011_siam_cse>`_
  has the slides I have so far, including slides for python-focused talks from
  other minisymposia at the conference.
  
November 2009, Guido van Rossum at our Py4Science seminar
  On November 4, we had a very interesting session with Guido van Rossum, the
  creator of the Python language.  See `this page <2009_guido_ucb/index.html>`_
  for details.

March 2009, SIAM CSE09
  I co-organized another Python mini-symposium at a SIAM meeting, this time the
  Computational Science and Engineering one.  I've `posted`_ a summary report
  on my blog, and `this page <2009_siam_cse>`_ has all the slides I have so
  far.
